Encrypt/Decrypt Web Application
A simple web application to encrypt and decrypt textual information that the user inputs. The application uses AES-256-CBC encryption to ensure the security of the data. The encryption key is stored securely using environment variables.

Features
Encrypt Text: Encrypts user-provided text using AES-256-CBC encryption.
Decrypt Text: Decrypts previously encrypted text.
Secure: Uses a 32-character encryption key stored in an environment variable for strong encryption.
Requirements
Node.js
npm (Node Package Manager)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/encrypt-decrypt-app.git
cd encrypt-decrypt-app
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your 32-character encryption key:

bash
Copy code
touch .env
echo "ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-32-character-long-encryption-key" >> .env
Usage
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
Open your browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
Use the application to encrypt and decrypt text.
